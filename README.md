Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game and mathematical/coding challenge based on the concept of cell replication. The cells in the game die and come to life based on a few simple rules: 
1. Any cell with fewer than 2 live neighbor cells dies. 
2. Any cell with 2 or 3 neighbors lives on.
3. Any cell with more then 3 neighbors dies. 
4. If a dead cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, it will return to life. 
This version of Game of Life features actual adorable cells in a Petri dish! The cells are randomly generated each time the game runs for different results every time.
